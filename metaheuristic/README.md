# Metaheuristic Approach – Tabu Search

This folder contains the **metaheuristic solution** developed to solve large-scale instances of the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)** with long-term and short-term vehicles.

Due to the **NP-hard nature** of the problem, exact methods (IBM CPLEX) become computationally expensive for large instances (50 and 100 clients).  
To address this limitation, a **Tabu Search metaheuristic** is implemented to obtain high-quality solutions within reasonable computation times.

## Overview of the Approach

The metaheuristic follows a standard **Tabu Search framework**:

1. **Initial solution generation**  
   A feasible solution is constructed by assigning clients to short-term and long-term vehicles while respecting all constraints.

2. **Neighborhood exploration**  
   Neighbor solutions are generated by relocating clients between routes of long-term and short-term vehicles.

3. **Tabu mechanism**  
   Recently visited solutions are stored in a tabu list to avoid cycling and encourage exploration.

4. **Aspiration criterion**  
   A tabu solution may be accepted if it improves the best-known solution.

5. **Stopping criteria**  
   The algorithm stops after a fixed number of iterations.
